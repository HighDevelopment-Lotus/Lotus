## Common Issue
 1. **My city is not loading.. It looks empty?** Please extend your texture budget in your graphic settings.
 2. **I cannot create a character?** There is a JS function that refuses to accept names that are:
- Weird like that: "dhuhqweuhduhqwe"
- That are not using capital letters "mike"
- That are way too long
- An incorrect birthdate (Like a month that doesnt exist for example: 01-13-2021)
 3. **My server keeps shutting down after entering my Forum Username and Licensekey?** Theres only one answer for that:
 Link your server ip to your account on https://pepe-framework.com/account/account-details as shown here: https://prnt.sc/20ougle
 4. **Police Vehicles spawn with plates "NONE" and no fuel?** Make sure to set your duty plates with /setplate!
