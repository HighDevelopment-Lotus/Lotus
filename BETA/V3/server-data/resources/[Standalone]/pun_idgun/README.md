# pun_idgun



This resource will get the coordinates, heading, rotation and hash of any entity you aim a gun at. The problem here is that GTA V uses Jenkin's one-at-a-time encryption to get the hashes and while it is possible to reverse that, it takes a bit of resources to do that and also I'm nowhere near clever enough to actually write a script that would decrypt that.



Installation:
Put the folder called `pun_idgun` into your resources folder, then refresh your resources and ensure the resource. You may rename the folder, I don't care about that. You can also make changes and redistribute it if you want to, don't care about that either.



I've looked at the functionality of multiple resources so without them I would not have been able to create this or even done some other things, so I'd feel bad not mentioning them:

• qalle_coords (For simple command that toggles on/off)

• object delete gun (For the aiming gun at object lines)

• SimpleCarHUD (For some text-elements and design)
